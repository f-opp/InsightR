#### svmLinear - Support Vector Machine
The concept of support vector classification algorithms is based on the assumption that the minimum distance of the decision boundary between two classes should be maximized. This linear decision boundary between two classes can be described by a few data points near the decision boundary, the so-called support vectors.[1][3]

| Very high accuracy due to modeling of non-linear correlations [2][3] | Performance depending on the problem, poor interpretability [2][3]|
